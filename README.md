Clubs can register and log in. After they do that they can add, delete 
and edit their players. The club profile shows information about the 
club and a list of all players. Clubs can also search for other clubs and 
players according to certain criteria. When they enter a player's profile 
they can remember it if they like it. These players are on the list of 
remembered players and then it is easier to find them.
